Description: Arrays of numbers for Python, optimized for small sizes
 Tinyarray is a numerical array module for Python.  The multi-dimensional arrays
 it provides are best thought of as (possibly nested) tuples of numbers that,
 unlike Python's built-in tuples, support mathematical operations.  Like tuples,
 tinyarrays are hashable and immutable and thus can be used as dictionary keys.
 The module's interface is a subset of that of NumPy and hence should be
 familiar to many Python programmers.  Tinyarray has been heavily optimized for
 small arrays: For example, common operations on 1-d arrays of length 3 run up
 to 35 times faster than with NumPy.  When storing many small arrays, memory
 consumption is reduced by a factor of 3.  In summary, Tinyarray is a more
 efficient alternative to NumPy when many separate small numerical arrays are to
 be used.
